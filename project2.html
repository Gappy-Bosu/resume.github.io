            <p>This is a WIP mod created for Garry's Mod, it is a fully custom gamemode.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The gamemode features a fully working HUD, which displays the characters customisable name, they currency, health, shield, and a portrait of their playermodel. At the bottom right it also states what they are holding and the ammo count if it is a weapon. The gamemode features a system in which you can create regiments and classes, and create your own experience through various menus. With a character creation planned, the regiment menu will display all the members in the role, the various classes you can be, and the rank system assigned for the regiment, with previews for all models assigned to these ranks.</p>
